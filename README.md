# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2022 - KringleCon V: Golden Rings

## Work in progress notice
I am still porting the PDF report to GitHub, therefore it may change over time (even be destroyed by errors :) ).
The only currently "stable" release is the PDF itself (thought I already noticed minor changes I'll have to fix).
The PDF is available here: [Lamonato Andrea - Writeup for SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2022.pdf](https://github.com/LamonatoAndrea/KringleCon5/blob/master/Lamonato%20Andrea%20-%20Writeup%20for%20SANS%20Holiday%20Hack%20Challenge%202022.pdf).

## Narrative
*Five Rings for the Christmas king immersed in cold*

*Each Ring now missing from its zone*

*The first with bread kindly given, not sold*

*Another to find 'ere pipelines get owned*

*One beneath a fountain where water flowed*

*Into clouds Grinchum had the fourth thrown*

*The fifth on blockchains where shadows be bold*

*One hunt to seek them all, five quests to find them*

*One player to bring them all, and Santa Claus to bind them*

## Conclusions
Hey folks, nice seeing you again! Thanks for this year’s challenge. Must admit it was a twist with respect
to previous years, most objectives felt kinda easier while the Glamtariel's Fountain was much more on the
CTF side. I must admit I missed Jack, but now I’ll just be looking forward to next year’s adventure!

### Inbox (1)
I must admit I saw that email just this year while doing the report! Really sorry for this but you deserve an
answer and you’ll get it as soon as this report is uploaded. Who's “you”? One of the images below should
be a hint on that, the other a response :)
