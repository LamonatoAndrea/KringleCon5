### Windows Event Logs
Difficulty: :christmas_tree::christmas_tree:

Investigate the Windows [event log](https://storage.googleapis.com/hhc22_player_assets/powershell.evtx) mystery in the terminal or offline. Get hints for this challenge by typing
hint in the upper panel of the Windows Event Logs terminal.

#### Solution
Please note that I used `evtx_dump.py`([python-evtx](https://pypi.org/project/python-evtx/)) to convert logs in a more readable format, the filename that will be used in commands is `powershell.evtx.dump`.

##### Question 1 - What month/day/year did the attack take place? - Answer: `12/24/2022`
Assuming there were multiple actions via PowerShell during the attack, I counted the number of logs by date and sorted by amount of logs with below command:
```bash
thedead@dellian:~$ for i in $(grep "TimeCreated" powershell.evtx.dump | cut -d '"' -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort | uniq); do a=$(grep "$i" powershell.evtx.dump | wc -l) && echo -e "$a\t$i"; done | sort -rn
3540	2022-12-24
2811	2022-12-23
2088	2022-12-13
1422	2022-11-19
240	2022-11-11
181	2022-12-04
46	2022-10-13
36	2022-12-18
36	2022-11-26
34	2022-11-01
```
The hardest part in this question was realizing that `2022-12-24` was the right answer in the wrong format :smile:

##### Question 2 - An attacker got a secret from a file. What was the original file's name? - Answer: `recipe_updated.txt`
Searching for `secret` within the dump file allows finding multiple `Get-Content` commands against the file
`Recipe.txt` and `recipe_updated.txt`, the latter being the answer.

##### Question 3 - The contents of the previous file were retrieved, changed, and stored to a variable by the attacker. This was done multiple times. Submit the last full PowerShell line that performed only these actions. - Answer: `$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'}`
Using the regex \$.*= in grep allows finding variable assignments within events:
```bash
thedead@dellian:~$ grep '<Data Name="ScriptBlockText"' powershell.evtx.dump | grep -e "\$.*=" | tail -n 5
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'} $foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'} $foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'</Data>
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'}</Data>
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'}</Data>
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'}</Data>
```

##### Question 4 - After storing the altered file contents into the variable, the attacker used the variable to run a separate command that wrote the modified data to a file. This was done multiple times. Submit the last full PowerShell line that performed only this action. - Answer: `$foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe'`
Previous questions led to the variable `$foo`, looking for it within the events identifies below usages:
```bash
thedead@dellian:~$ grep '<Data Name="ScriptBlockText"' powershell.evtx.dump | grep "\$foo" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
3 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe.txt'</Data>
2 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'}</Data>1 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'}</Data>
1 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'} $foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'</Data>
1 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'} $foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'
1 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'</Data>
1 <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">$foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe'</Data>
```
With above command it is possible to observe that the only write command being called multiple times is `$foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe'`.

##### Question 5 - The attacker ran the previous command against one file multiple times. What is the name of this file? - Answer: `Recipe.txt`
Previous question counted the occurrences of the `$foo` variable, and the file with most hits is `Recipe.txt`.

##### Question 6 - Were any files deleted? - Answer: `Yes`
Searching for the `del` command it is possible to observe the below two deletion events:
```bash
thedead@dellian:~$ grep '<Data Name="ScriptBlockText"' powershell.evtx.dump | grep "del "
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">del .\Recipe.txt</Data>
<Data Name="ScriptBlockText">del .\recipe_updated.txt</Data>
```

##### Question 7 - Was the original file (from question 2) deleted? - Answer: `No`
To be fair, no-think 50% chance :)

##### Question 8 - What is the Event ID of the logs that show the actual command lines the attacker typed and ran? - Answer: `4104`
`4104` is the Event ID that logs the scriptblock [https://www.myeventlog.com/search/show/980](https://www.myeventlog.com/search/show/980).

##### Question 9 - Is the secret ingredient compromised? - Answer: `Yes`
Command `$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_-replace 'honey','fish oil'} $foo | Add-Content -Path 'recipe_updated.txt'` identified in question 3 substituted `honey` with `fish oil` in the `recipe_updated.txt` file.

##### Question 10 - What is the secret ingredient? - Answer: `Honey`
As per previous question, it was possible to identify the substitution of `honey` with `fish oil` in the `recipe_updated.txt` file.
