### Windows Event Logs

#### Solution
Please note that I used `evtx_dump.py`([python-evtx](https://pypi.org/project/python-evtx/)) to convert logs in a more readable format, the filename that will be used in commands is `powershell.evtx.dump`.

##### Question 1 - What month/day/year did the attack take place? - Answer: `12/24/2022`
Assuming there were multiple actions via PowerShell during the attack, I counted the number of logs by date and sorted by amount of logs with below command:
```bash
thedead@dellian:~$ for i in $(grep "TimeCreated" powershell.evtx.dump | cut -d '"' -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort | uniq); do a=$(grep "$i" powershell.evtx.dump | wc -l) && echo -e "$a\t$i"; done | sort -rn
3540	2022-12-24
2811	2022-12-23
2088	2022-12-13
1422	2022-11-19
240	2022-11-11
181	2022-12-04
46	2022-10-13
36	2022-12-18
36	2022-11-26
34	2022-11-01
```
The hardest part in this question was realizing that `2022-12-24` was the right answer in the wrong format :smile:
