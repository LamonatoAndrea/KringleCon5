# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2022 - KringleCon V: Golden Rings
## Recover The Burning Ring of Fire
### Mistakes were made... the key
While I was re-doing the challenges, I lost my key at a certain point… I went on Discord and noticed I was not the only one on the naughty list. I then followed the hint of looking for a helpful soul above the ground and ended up in a secret chamber behind the castle. There I met the Santa Magic!
There I had to prove myself to Santa. I went on a lonely quest:
* Found [Yukon Cornelius](), and helped him track down a [Bumble]¹.
Took a tooth from the Bumble and carried it deep into the Misty Mountains, and traded it with Gwairhair, Windlord of the Great Eagles, for one of his feathers.
I had to show all my Social Engineering competences to convince Gwairhair to trade as he didn’t believe that I was sent from Santa himself.
Once the feather was obtained, I climbed the walls of Sombertown to find the home of Burgermeister Meisterburger.
I tickled Burgermeister Meisterburger with the feather and he started laughing and feeling joy
He was so happy that he gave me a safe passage to the Isle of Misfit Toys...
There,I had to find Dolly, and told her that even if she wrote those she's perfectly fine…
That was me, setting right one of the greatest wrongs of the Christmas season, so Santa considered me worthy and…made me aware that he was joking with me: no quest required and he just gave me my key. Still…take a look through the links guys :)
