# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2022 - KringleCon V: Golden Rings
## Recover The Burning Ring of Fire
### Mistakes were made... the key
While I was re-doing the challenges, I lost my key at a certain point… I went on Discord and noticed I was not the only one on the naughty list. I then followed the hint of looking for a helpful soul above the ground and ended up in a secret chamber behind the castle. There I met the Santa Magic!
There I had to prove myself to Santa. I went on a lonely quest:
* Found [Yukon Cornelius](https://christmas-specials.fandom.com/wiki/Yukon_Cornelius), and helped him track down a [Bumble](https://rudolphtherednosedreindeer.fandom.com/wiki/Bumble)[¹](https://bumble.com/).
* Took a tooth from the Bumble and carried it deep into the Misty Mountains, and traded it with [Gwairhair](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gwaihir), Windlord of the Great Eagles, for one of his feathers.
* I had to show all my Social Engineering competences to convince Gwairhair to trade as he didn’t believe that I was sent from Santa himself.
* Once the feather was obtained, I climbed the walls of [Sombertown](https://kingdomheartsfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Sombertown) to find the home of [Burgermeister Meisterburger](https://christmas-specials.fandom.com/wiki/Burgermeister_Meisterburger).
* I tickled Burgermeister Meisterburger with the feather and he started laughing and feeling joy
* He was so happy that he gave me a safe passage to the [Isle of](https://theisleofmisfittoys.com/) [Misfit Toys](https://christmas-specials.fandom.com/wiki/Misfit_Toys)...
* There,I had to find [Dolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton), and told her that even if [she wrote those](https://youtu.be/k1hj6E3_nfI) she's perfectly fine…
That was me, setting right one of the greatest wrongs of the Christmas season, so Santa considered me worthy and…made me aware that he was joking with me: no quest required and he just gave me my key. Still…take a look through the links guys :smile:
