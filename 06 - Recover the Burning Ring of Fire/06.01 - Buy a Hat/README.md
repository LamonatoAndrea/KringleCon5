### Buy a Hat
Difficulty: :christmas_tree::christmas_tree:  
Travel to the Burning Ring of Fire and purchase a hat from the vending machine with KringleCoin. Find hints for this objective hidden throughout the tunnels.

#### Hints
##### Hat Dispensary
*From: Wombley Cube*
To purchase a hat, first find the hat vending machine in the Burning Ring of Fire. Select the hat that you think will give your character a bold and jaunty look, and click on it. A window will open giving you instructions on how to proceed with your purchase.

##### Prepare to Spend
*From: Wombley Cube*
Before you can purchase something with KringleCoin, you must first approve the financial transaction. To do this, you need to find a KTM; there is one in the Burning Ring of Fire. Select the Approve a KringleCoin transfer button. You must provide the target wallet address, the amount of the transaction you're approving, and your private wallet key.

##### Wear It Proudly!
*From: Wombley Cube*
You should have been given a target address and a price by the Hat Vending machine. You should also have been given a Hat ID # . Approve the transaction and then return to the Hat Vending machine. You'll be asked to provide the Hat ID and your wallet address. Complete the transaction and wear your hat proudly!

#### Solution
Just pick a hat from [https://prod-hats-vending.kringle.co.in/](https://prod-hats-vending.kringle.co.in/), different hats have different addresses to send the KringleCoins to. I bought [![tophat3_houndstooth](imgs/tophat3_houndstooth_small.png)](imgs/tophat3_houndstooth.png) because, why not?
Pre-approved a 10KC transaction to `0x5251D7091fA38DbE398dd6a860FA510dA3ABAE01` and then went to the hat vending machine, given the wallet address and the hat ID `273`.

##### That special hat!
After losing myself 10+ times in the wall I was finally able to obtain that one hat to rule them all, the one hat to find them, the one hat to exploit them and in the darkness [meterpreter](https://media.tenor.com/z6X-NO4N6TwAAAAd/metasploit-meterpreter.gif) them.
